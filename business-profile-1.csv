He was getting ready to end his college career. He was about to graduate and his resume wouldn't give him the rage he wanted. I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit. So when my husband passed away I decided to start making candles as a project. At the time it was to help my dad to support him as a give back. We started with candles as a purpose and then we expanded from the giving portion to a candle manufacturing business. We started doing popups and then it went from there. Now we're ready to put in our all and make this a priority.","2","459999","{""hasBusinessAddress"":true,""addressLine1"":""2501 Chatham Road Springfield Illinois 62704, Suite R"",""zipCode"":null,""addressLine2"":null,""state"":null,""city"":null}","www.tiktok.com/@maxcandleco","[]","0884bc73-a0c0-457f-ab26-dbc359fd3b3e","0884bc73-a0c0-457f-ab26-dbc359fd3b3e","GRANTED","21a73085-af15-4ed8-a667-5e97757d29a1","51284","2025-04-08T00:57:18.666Z","No",true

      "recommendation": "The business should start offering bespoke orders and creating a line of scented oils to diversify their product offerings and cater to a broader range of customer needs and preferences. They should focus on building recurring customers by offering additional products and services like travel-sized versions of their candles or limited-edition scents. To improve performance, they could experiment with cross-selling and upselling strategies, launch subscription boxes, and stay up to date on consumer trends and industry changes to innovate their product offerings and tailor their marketing strategies.",
